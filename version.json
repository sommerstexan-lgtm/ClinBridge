    "🔍 Check for Updates — new button in Settings to manually check any time",
    "📅 Day-of-week scheduling — set any event to fire only on specific days (e.g. Sunday-only weekly backup reminder)",
    "💾 Backup Now event action — one tap from a notification saves your full backup file instantly without closing the notification",
    "🔄 Backup and Sync split — 'Backup Data Now' and 'Sync to Another Device' are now two separate notification action buttons",
    "📋 All Notes — View every note across all dates newest-first, with event category filtering and edit/delete for all dates",

  "fixes": [
    "Settings not restoring after data import — loadSettings now uses a full deep merge restoring every saved property including fluidIncrement, weightUnit, weightAlertThreshold, customActivities, and any future fields",
    "iOS double-reload after import — version key is now pre-set before reload so the version-check code does not trigger a second hard reload on top of the import reload",
    "Import now validates the file is a real ClinBridge backup before writing to localStorage",
    "All Notes 'View All' button was disappearing when Today/History toggle was tapped — fixed header update to use innerHTML preserving the button",

    "Activity timing Before/After buttons — added checkmark, solid color fill, and green confirmation message",
